Building robust client-server applications in C# can be a challenging yet rewarding endeavor, especially when dealing with asynchronous communication over TCP/IP. When I first approached this task, I encountered various pitfalls such as race conditions, deadlocks, and inefficient resource management.
In this tutorial, I will guide you through the process of building a well-structured server and client console application using C# and .NET. My focus will be on establishing asynchronous TCP/IP communication between these two components, resulting in an efficient and scalable system. I will cover everything from setting up the project structure to implementing asynchronous communication, handling multiple client connections, and applying best practices for error handling and resource management.
Whether you're an experienced C# developer looking to improve your networking skills, or a novice who wants to understand the intricacies of client-server architecture, this guide will provide you with practical insights and a solid foundation for your future projects.
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have the knowledge to build your own robust, asynchronous client-server applications in C# with confidence. Let's dive in and turn the complexities of networking into a series of clear, manageable steps.

First have a look at the "What you will learn" section: [here](/docs/documentation.md)

Note: This project is a learning project for me. I want to have a complete understanding of clean system architecture, clean code and so on. Therefore, this tutorial is certainly not bug-free, so I am very happy about suggestions for improvement and bug reports.
